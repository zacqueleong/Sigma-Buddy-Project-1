2. Explain the feature you are most proud of. What techniques/methods you've used?

####################################################### 

[Zacque]
I am happy with the way the hero section turned out, the video background and the wording help attract the visual attention to the page.

Secondly the transition effect of the navigation bar as we scroll down, this was accomplished with the help of javascript element manipulation with two set of colour schemes (dark/light)

[Sam]
Using Html & CSS , i am glad that overlay and flexbox work . Understand more how css work especially using the element. 

[Angie]
Most proud of display blog image behind the text, I thought have to use css animation originally to display the image behind the text, after I search online only realise z-index can make the effect .

3. Name one coding struggle and how you dealt with it.

####################################################### 

[Zacque]
I struggled with maintaining class names during the project, that prompted me to search for best practices and i discovered BEM (Block Element Modifer) class naming convention. 

I tried integrating BEM convention into my work and it help to provide a coding standard in my work.

[Sam]
Totally no idea about flexbox , overlay , hover. Try to search from google , Sigma lesson.

[Angie]
Figuring out how make the input box and textarea box display side by side taking equal space when no wrap. 

I thought when I set display:flex at contact__input, the contact__inputContainer and contact__textarea each will take 50% of contact__input but it did not work.

After that I fix that with adding flex:1 to contact__inputContainer and contact__textarea.

####################################################### 

4. Name one improvement you would like to work on.

####################################################### 

[Zacque]
I would like to spend more time on implementing media query/ responsive website features like hamburger icon with dropdown nav menu. Currently the webpage is not 100% responsive.

[Sam]
Debugging , Learning new technologies and time management 

[Angie]
I would like to improve on media query part next time. 

After tried several time I still cant make the contact__input flex:wrap based on the media queries width I set.
